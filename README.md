Hi! I'm Adam Dubey - a senior Technical Engineer specializing in DevOps & SDET Automation. I have a tenacious passion for exploring and tinkering with various technologies to better enable teams to work more efficiently.

## My Rules of Conduct

🤔🍎 Beginner's mindset and curiosity in approaching new unknowns.<br />
📐🛠 Apply first-principles thinking when approaching new challenges.<br />
🚀🌔 It can be done. Go for the Moonshot!<br />
🔍🚧 Check small things. Build Margins of Safety. Implement Redundancies for critical systems.<br />
🙌👍 Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. Shared understanding and consensus to accomplish desired end goals. Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.<br />
✅🛬 Be pragmatic, have strong opinions, loosely held. Remember Occam's Razor, _when faced with two solutions that explain data equally well, the simplest solution is often the correct one._
